In here I'll have my first contact with Files and Serialization. 
Differently from other projects, this one is made by following a tutorial from The Odin Project.

In here I've had the first contact with an API - the google API of Civic Info - with ERB and reading content from a CSV file. 

I've struggled a lot on managing how to get date, time and weekdays from it.
